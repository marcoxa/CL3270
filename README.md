DESCRIPTION
-----------

A clone of the [GO3270](https://github.com/racingmars/go3270) library
by Matthew R. Wilson.

The library follows very closely the GO code with some minimal **Common
Lisp** idioms (e.g., practically no use of the Condition System).

It is a good exercise for learning a number of things, including
[USOCKET](https://common-lisp.net/project/usocket/api-docs.shtml).

The library has been tested on W10 with [Lispworks](www.lispworks.com)
(a version using the native `COMM` package also works), but is should
be portable to other **Common Lisp** systems.


A NOTE ON FORKING
-----------------

Of course you are free to fork the project subject to the current
licensing scheme.  However, before you do so, I ask you to consider
plain old "cooperation" by asking me to become a developer.
It helps keeping the entropy at an acceptable level.


Enjoy.
