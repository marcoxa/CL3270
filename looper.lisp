  "A higher-level interface to the SHOW-SCREEN function.

HANDLE-SCREEN will loop until all validation rules are satisfied, and only
return when an expected AID (i.e. PF) key is pressed.

HANDLE-SCREEN will return when the user: 1) presses a key in pfkeys AND all
fields pass validation, OR 2) the user presses a key in exitkeys. In all
other cases, HANDLE-SCREEN will re-present the screen to the user again,
possibly with an error message set in the errorField field.

Arguments and Values:

SCREEN -- the screen to display (see SHOW-SCREEN).
RULES -- the rules to enforce: each key in the Rules map corresponds
         to a FIELD-NAME in the SCREEN array.
VALS  -- field values you wish to override (see SHOW-SCREEN).
PF-KEYS, EXIT-KEYS -- the AID keys that you wish to accept (that is,
   perform validation and return if successful) and treat as exit keys
   (unconditionally return).
ERROR-FIELD -- the name of a field in the screen array that you wish error
   messages to be written in when HANDLE-SCREEN loops waiting for a valid
   user submission.
CURS-ROW, CURS-COL -- the initial cursor position.
CONN -- the network connection to the 3270 client.
